## My Blockchain Bank App(Bank of Ghana (Crypto Version))

### How this app coomunicates with the blockchain

- [ ] We need ethers, so we install and import the ethers. Ethers helps us to communicate with the blockchain network
- [ ] We need the contractABI, this is a json file which includes all the state and functions of our smart contract. This helps us to communicate and make transactions on the blockchain network
- App.js file helps us intereact with the blockahin network

### How to use the bank app

- [ ] Connect the app with your metamask wallet or any other crypto wallet
- [ ] Once your are connected, ensure you have funds in your account
- [ ] You can then deposit funds from your metamask wallet to your bank account
- [ ] You can also withdraw funds from your bank account into your metamask wallet


### How to run the app locally
- [ ] Git clone the project `git clone https://github.com/addod19/bankSmartContract.git`
- [ ] We need to install all our dependencies with the command `npm install`
- [ ] Now we can start the server with `npm start` command
